    <p>Pumpkin spice originally referred to the spices traditionally paired with pumpkin: usually some combination of cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, ginger, and mace (some recipes use allspice instead of mace, but mace and nutmeg come from the same plant hence their association here). But these spices aren’t just grouped together because they’re great with pumpkin. Instead, their association with one another goes back to spice trading routes and that we might not even have coffee without this lucky combination of spices.</p>
